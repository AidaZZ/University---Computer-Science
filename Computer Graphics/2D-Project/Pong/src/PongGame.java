                    //HashMap: A hash table-based implementation of the Map interface.
                    //EventObject: The root class from which all event state objects shall be derived.
                     //Observer: The interface for objects that receive event notifications.
import javax.swing.*;//an extension of java.awt that includes a set of lightweight components (Swing components) that enhance the functionality and look-and-feel of GUIs. Some key classes include:
                    //JFrame: A top-level container that represents the main window of an application.
